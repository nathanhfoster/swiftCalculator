There are now 5 different fields to my app.

1. Var text field - This is where a user can enter in a string that will be the key to a dictionary of variables.

2. Value text field - This is where a user can enter in a string that will be the value to a dictionary of variables.

3. Create button - This is a action button that will append the key value pair entered into the Var and Value text fields.

4. Use button - This is a action button that will hash the string entered into the Var text field and inject the corresponding value into the display text field at the top of the calculator.

5. Undo button - This action button pops the last entered string in the stack.
